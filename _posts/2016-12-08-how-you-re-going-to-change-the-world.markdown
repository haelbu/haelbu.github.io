I don't know when. But it will start as something small. 

Maybe even just one person initially. That's somewhere, a foot forward, the cornerstone of change. All I need to do is ignite another, put the fire behind their eyes. I don't have to be their hero. I just have to make them think. I have to make them feel. 

How. But how? That is a question. I know the tool, but every tool needs finesse and skill, a purpose, a direction. How, indeed.
